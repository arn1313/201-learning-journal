Another day another well...project
We have learned more about framework and how to work things out before getting to the code.
We are now trying to incorporate the random generators from last week and apply them to images.
This is the hardest thing i have ever done. Every day i am reminded of this but i am still loving it.
Going to go home now and rest my brain and hit the Bus Mall fresh in the morning.
