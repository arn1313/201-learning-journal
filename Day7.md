Day 7
I will keep this one quick as i really don't have any bandwidth right now.

We have learned about objects and literal vs constructor models. Although i find the constructor model easier, i am currently completely stuck on them.

WE have learned about creating tables and formatting in JS vs CSS.

I will go into more detail on the next on the next journal. I am trying to sell some tasty fish cookies.
