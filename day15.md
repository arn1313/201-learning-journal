Here we go into final project week.
We have spent a good amount of time this week learning how to work with local storage and how to have it persist through a screen refresh.
We also spent some time really mucking up a github repository and figuring out how to fix it. We made a group decision not to merge anything without everyones blessing, so hopefully we will ave minimal merge issues.
