Had a productive day. I drove with Katherine navigating. I learned a lot about CSS. Mostly that i just havent been patient enough when doing it.
I just assumed she used some dark magic on it but reality it is just sitting there and making minor adjustments over and over again until she gets the look she wants.
Looking forward to working on the About US page today.
