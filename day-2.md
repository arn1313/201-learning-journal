# Learning Journal: Day 2

Today i wrote code that i made up in my own little head.

I learned about:
1. If/Else and If/else/Else
2. We learned the diffrences between the functions of HTML CSS and JS.

Html is the structure of a page.
If involves markup, reference, linkage and is the center document of the three.

CSS provides the style and layout.

JS provides functionality, behavior and interactions for the user.

3. We also learned the difference between Objects and Events.

Objects are the data we use or the noun and involve arrays.

Events are the actions (verb) that give us flow and function.

4. We learned a lot about github and the diffrence between git and github.

Git is the software and Github is the storage of projects.

Most of all i started my awesome about me page!
