It has been a crazy week.
So much to take in and so little time to get it.
I have learned that CSS is far my difficult than i had thought. It will take a long time to master but i am ok with that.

We learned about debugging and using the DOM to check for errors. This is super handy.

Todays project gave us a taste of what it would be like to have an employer hand us a task to create. Recreating a static image is pretty hard but Google is our friend.
