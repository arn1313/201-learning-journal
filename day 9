Wow what a week.
I had my first date with imposter syndrome, so that was cool.
We have learned a lot about creating tables using JS and linking them through html tags. We have learned out to use event listeners to provide  a more interactive experience.
I have also learned you ,must be very careful when modeling your code off of others. It sounds easy but tracking the details is arduous. It is best to look at it as a example and not a model.
We have touched on CSS style elements but i hope we go a little deeper.
