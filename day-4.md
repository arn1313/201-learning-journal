#Learning Journal Day 4

The last few days have been intense.
Yesterday we studied For Loops and While Loops.
Not gonna lie, it was a rough day but that had much to do with linter issues wearing me down prior to getting to my code.

While loops can be arduous and like to cause infinite loops

We also learned about the linkage for our CSS and JS pages.
We learned some basics of CSS styling and how to utilize the the various properties to make a cleaner page.

We also learned about positioning of our elements and the differences between absolute, fixed and floating elements.

Today we touched on functions and added them to our about me pages.
