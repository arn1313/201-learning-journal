Another crazy week.
We have learned how to use JS to draw charts and libraries we can use to modify our pages.
We also learned about how we store data locally and a whole assortment of commands available in the DOM.
I think we have collectively learned that trying incorporate other peoples code to our own is challenging and quite often doesn't end up helping at all.
