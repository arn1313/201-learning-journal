Working on a team can be challenging. I have been part of many teams over the course of my life but the dynamic of a coding team is very different.
We have some big personalities on my team and they like to comically butt heads a lot. Some times this seems to go on a bit to long but they do generally like each other.
I am really hoping we get to do some paired programming today.
